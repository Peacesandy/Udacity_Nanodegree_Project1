                 Scars are a normal part of life, and youll be hard-pressed to find someone without one. When a scar forms on the skin, its 
                 a way of the body healing from an injury, whether intentional or elective, as with surgery, for example. Any cut, scrape,
                  incision, burn, or other type of damage thats done to the skin causes the body to react by creating 
                 scar tissue, which consists primarily of collagen. This tissue essentially allows the affected skin to close and heal properly.

                Theres no way to know how a scar will form. Several factors dictate scar formation, including 
                the degree of inflammation caused by the injury, the size, severity, and location of the wound,
                 how the damaged skin was initially cared for, and the current condition of your skin, which is 
                 why no two are exactly alike. When a scar first forms, its usually red or pink, and the area
                  can be tender. Then, over time, the scar will transform as it matures. Some scars are thick 
                  and red, while others are short, thin, and white. 
                There are multiple types of scars, too, resulting from the amount of collagen the body creates as part of the healing response.
