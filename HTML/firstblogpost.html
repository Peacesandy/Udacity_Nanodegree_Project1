            <p class="justify-align">Oily and acne-prone skin must be moisturized so oil production doesn't go into overdrive. 
                However, using the best moisturizer for acne-prone skin comes down to the ingredients in the formulation and the texture. 
                A good place to start is with non-comedogenic moisturizers, which lack pore-clogging ingredients known to cause breakouts
                Moisturizers with mattifying ingredients can help prevent a shiny or greasy aftereffect. It's also a good idea to choose lightweight lotions, serums, and gels that are void of fragrances, oils, and butter over heavy, rich creams since these textures are better suited for oily and acne-prone skin. Key ingredients to look for in moisturizers for acneic skin include salicylic acid, retinol, and niacinamide, all of which help keep the skin balanced and prevent unsolicited breakouts. However, if you are using prescription-strength medications to help control your acne, make sure that the moisturizers you choose are compatible with the medication. Sometimes, 
                a heavier cream-based product will lend much-needed moisture if dry, irritated, and peeling skin is an issue.  </p>

            <p class="justify-align">Acne-prone skin and serums are like a match made in heaven. That's because serums are 
                lightweight skincare products with a stronger concentration of active ingredients, 
                making them a good option for fighting breakouts and clarifying skin. Unlike a spot
                 treatment, formulated to be applied to a specific area of the face, a serum can be used all over, 
                 helping to keep acneic skin in check. While acne serums are not as potent as spot treatments, 
                 they are the perfect solution for maintaining the skin after a breakout or keeping the skin on a
                  clear and healthy track. Some of the best serums for acne contain salicylic acid, 
                retinol, and niacinamide, all of which work to exfoliate the skin and unclog pores for clearer-looking skin. </p>
